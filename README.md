# GrandMA3-Patch2PDF

## Overview ##

This open source projects allows users of the GrandMA3 software (OnPC and Consoles) to export the fixture patch as an PDF file to an USB thumb drive.

Currently the following attributes are getting exported to the PDF file:
- Type (Fixture, Channel, Multipatch, Houselight, etc.)
- Fixture ID and Channel ID
- Fixture Type and Mode
- Fixture Name
- Universe and Address

You can sort the export by:
- Patch Window Order
- Fixture ID
- DMX Address

You can group the exported fixtures by:
- Universe
- Stage

You can select to either export the whole patch or just the currently selected fixtures. Also you can choose to group the fixtures by universe - then for every universe a new page is being created. Please note that when grouping is enabled, the selected sorting feature is being ignored.

This plugin is pretty new and currently in beta testing - at this stage of development, errors can occur: please create an issue if you find anything which is not working as intended.

## Installation ##

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/leonreucher/grandma3-patch2pdf/releases/latest) and copy the two files from the archive to your GrandMA3 installation or onto an USB device. In GrandMA3 import the files from the plugins pool.

## Credits ##
The creation of the PDF document is based on the code from https://github.com/catseye/pdf.lua.

## Known limitations ##
Currently all stages in the patch are being exported - it is planned to add a filter option for selecting only the stages which should be exported.
